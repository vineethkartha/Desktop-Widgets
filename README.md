# Desktop-Widgets
This is a project with some simple desktop widgets which I have created using PyGTK.
The currently available widget is:
* TemperatureMonitor -- This is suppose to keep track of your CPU temperature every 5 seconds.
* dailyVocabulary -- This widget displays the word for the day from the website wordsmith.org
* Comic of the day
All these widgets are created in python and they need the libraries
BeautifullSoup and PyGI
## Installation of Libraries

* sudo apt-get install python3-gi
* sudo apt-get install python3-bs4
